This is a simple application that allows users to register. The goal is to be
a small coding task. Don't spend more than 1 hour.


## User registration

* Users should be able to register via an API Endpoint.
* A new user model should be created. Users have a unique email, first_name,
  last_name, zipcode, street and country
* This should be programmed with a simple Form object. You can go plain ruby
  object, or a gem, as you like.
* The users then receive a token in their model. That token has to be unique.
* Please write some basic tests.

## View details for the given user

* API Endpoint that returns details for the given user
* A token is required to access this endpoint and give user access.
* Please write a basic test.


Pick the tools you like and feel comfortable with. The goal is for me to see how you program.
